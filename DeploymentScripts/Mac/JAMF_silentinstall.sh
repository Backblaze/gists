# BZERROR MEANINGS 
# BZERROR:190 - The System Preferences process is running on the computer. Close System Preferences and retry the installation.
# BZERROR:1000 - This is a general error code. One possible reason is that the Backblaze installer doesnâ€™t have root permissions and is failing. Please see the install log file for more details.
# BZERROR:1016/1003 - Login Error... Email account exists but is not a member of indicated Group, Group ID is incorrect, or Group token is incorrect,
